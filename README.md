# unomiTrackerSite

This repository contains a Website that can be used to test the Apache Unomi web tracker.

## Start the website

You can use the following docker-compose file to start an environment containing both Apache Unomi, Elasticsearch and the Unomi Trakcer site.

```yaml
version: '2.4'

networks:
    unomi-net:
        name: unomi-net
        ipam:
            config:
                - subnet: 172.24.24.0/24

services:

        environment:
            - discovery.type=single-node
            - ELASTIC_PASSWORD=password1234
        ports:
            - 9200:9200
        mem_limit: 8gb
        cpus: 4
        ulimits:
            memlock:
                soft: -1
                hard: -1

    unomi:

        networks:
          unomi-net:
            ipv4_address: 172.24.24.100
        environment:
            UNOMI_ELASTICSEARCH_ADDRESSES: elasticsearch:9200            
            UNOMI_CLUSTER_INTERNAL_ADDRESS: https://jcustomer.jahia.net:9443

            UNOMI_HAZELCAST_NETWORK_PORT: 5701
            UNOMI_ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD: password1234
        ports:
            - 8181:8181
            - 9443:9443
            - 5005:5005

    trackersite:
        image:  jahia/qa-mf-unomi-tracker-site:latest
        mem_limit: 2gb
        environment:
            UNOMI_URL: http://localhost:8181
        networks:
            - unomi-net
        ports:
            - 8000:80
```

Save this file as `docker-compose.yml` and from that same folder, execute the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up

```

Wait for a few seconds for Apache Unomi to start, you can then open up your browser at `http://localhost:8000`

## Testing procedure

Once the environment is started, the tracker can be verified following this procedure:
 
### Test1 : page visit increment
 
 In Unomi API check the number of views for index.html, this can be done using the following `curl` request: 

```bash
curl --request POST 'http://localhost:8181/cxs/query/event/target.properties.pageInfo.destinationURL' \
   -u 'karaf:karaf' \
   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   --data-raw '{"condition": { "type": "sessionPropertyCondition", "parameterValues": { "comparisonOperator": "between", "propertyName": "timeStamp", "propertyValues": [ 0, 9999999999999 ] } }}' 
```

PS: Update the URL and credentials according to your environment.

```json
 {"_all":849,"_filtered":849, "http://trackersite.jahia.net:19090/index.html":1}%     
```

Next, access the website at `http://localhost:8000`

Then check again the number of views using the previous `curl` request, the number (previously `849`) should have been incremented.
 
### Test2 : categories, tags, interests
 
 In a new private browser, access the website at `http://localhost:8000`, then visit the pages "golf", "football" and "basketball".

 Next, check in Unomi if a user profile has been created using the following `curl` request.
 
` request to use will be like the following (please refer to your unomi url): ` 

``` bash 
curl --request POST 'http://localhost:8181/cxs/profiles/search' \
    -u 'karaf:karaf' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{"text" : "","offset" : 0,"limit" : 1000,"sortby" : "properties.lastName:asc,properties.firstName:desc","condition" : { }}' 
```

PS: Update the URL and credentials according to your environment.

```json
{"list":[{"itemId":"230165da-87f7-49d3-8fd6-de1b88476593","itemType":"profile","version":5,"properties":{"nbOfVisits":1,"lastVisit":"2022-09-16T12:13:10Z","firstVisit":"2022-09-16T12:13:10Z","pageViewCount":{"JahiaMfIntegTests":4}},"systemProperties":{"lastUpdated":"2022-09-16T12:13:21Z"},"segments":[],"scores":{},"mergedWith":null,"consents":{}}, â€¦} 
```

 The profile should have:
  * the tags "sport 3, basketball 1, football 1, golf 1"
  * the categories "basketball 1, football 1, golf 1"
  * the interests "ball sport 2, rich men sport 1, basketball 1, football 1, golf 1"
 
### Test3 : form
 
Follow this procedure:

 * Access the website page "form"
 * Fill the form
 * Check the new profile, it should contains the firstname, lastname and email setted previously
